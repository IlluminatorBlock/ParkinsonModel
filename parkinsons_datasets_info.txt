# Parkinson's Disease MRI Datasets Reference Guide

## Overview
This document contains information about MRI datasets that are relevant for Parkinson's disease detection. Our current model uses synthetic data that mimics the characteristics of these real-world datasets.

## Our Model's Approach

The Parkinson's detection model in this project uses fully synthetic 3D MRI data (128×128×128 voxels) generated to simulate realistic brain features including:

- Ventricle enlargement (common in neurodegenerative diseases)
- Substantia nigra degeneration (hallmark of Parkinson's disease)
- Basal ganglia alterations (affected in movement disorders)
- Asymmetric degeneration patterns (characteristic of early PD)

The synthetic data generation allows for training without the privacy concerns and access limitations of real patient data, while still capturing the relevant features needed for model development.

## Using Real Data

To use real datasets instead of synthetic data with our model:

1. Apply for access to the relevant dataset(s)
2. Download the MRI volumes in NIfTI format
3. Modify the data loading component in the `create_datasets()` function
4. Ensure preprocessing steps match the model's expected input (128×128×128 normalized volumes)

The model architecture itself (DeepVoxelCNN) works with both synthetic and real 3D MRI data without modification, as long as the preprocessing steps produce consistently sized and normalized inputs.
