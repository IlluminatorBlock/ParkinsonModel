## Executive Summary
This project aims to develop an advanced computer vision system leveraging Small-Angle Free-Water Advanced Neurological MRI (SA-FW-ANMRI) to detect subtle brain changes associated with Parkinson's disease years before clinical symptoms manifest. By combining state-of-the-art deep learning techniques with specialized medical imaging, the system will enable early intervention opportunities and provide quantitative tools for monitoring disease progression.

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 10 million people worldwide. Current diagnosis typically occurs after 60-80% of dopaminergic neurons have already degenerated and obvious motor symptoms appear, significantly limiting treatment efficacy. There is a critical need for sensitive neuroimaging biomarkers that can identify PD pathology in its earliest stages.

### 1.2 Project Goals
- Develop a novel computer vision system capable of detecting PD-related brain changes 5+ years before clinical symptoms appear
- Create a multi-parametric analysis pipeline for comprehensive feature extraction from SA-FW-ANMRI
- Design specialized neural network architectures optimized for neurodegeneration pattern recognition
- Validate the system against clinical progression metrics with high sensitivity and specificity
- Establish a quantitative framework for monitoring disease progression over time

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- Detection accuracy exceeding 90% for pre-symptomatic individuals who later develop clinical PD
- Statistically significant improvement over current state-of-the-art neuroimaging biomarkers
- Publication of results in a Q1 neuroscience or medical imaging journal
- System capable of processing and analyzing a new patient scan in under 10 minutes
