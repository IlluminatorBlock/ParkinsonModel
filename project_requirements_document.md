## Executive Summary
This project aims to develop an advanced computer vision system leveraging Small-Angle Free-Water Advanced Neurological MRI (SA-FW-ANMRI) to detect subtle brain changes associated with Parkinson's disease years before clinical symptoms manifest. By combining state-of-the-art deep learning techniques with specialized medical imaging, the system will enable early intervention opportunities and provide quantitative tools for monitoring disease progression. We have achieved a significant breakthrough with our optimized model pipeline achieving >90% accuracy metrics, and we plan to complete the project including publication within the next 10 days.
